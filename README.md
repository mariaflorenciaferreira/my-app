# PROYECTO VIVERO

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This project

This e-commerce is my React JS final project. In order to learn and practice react related tools, me and my classmates had to learn to use hooks and to include firebase in our app.
In the e-commerce you will find plants and tools for gardening.

The user will be able to add to the cart items from different categories and also delete them from the cart.
Once the user finishes picking products, he`ll have to complete his information in order to complete the purchase.
